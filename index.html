                    <p> I have always been a very curious person growing up, and as a UX/UI designer I love being able to take that curiosity and listen to and learn about people in order to create creative, innovative design solutions. </p>
                    <p> My education in statistics and media studies helped me discover my interest in collecting and analyzing data and the importance of effectively conveying the story behind that data. </p>
                    <p> I was born and raised in Northern Virginia - just 20 minutes outside of Washington D.C. Through my love for travel, I have been visited many parts of the world beyond Virginia to experience different cultures through experiences, people, and food! </p>
                    <p> Thank you for getting to know me and my work! I am currently looking for new opportunities, and would love to hear from you about any positions or just to chat! </p>
